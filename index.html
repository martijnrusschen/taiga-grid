            <p>As an interface designer and engineer I wanted to create an HTML5/CSS3 environment that easily sets up the basics of a responsive web application or website. It needed a grid that is flexible and fluid. Also some basic types like forms en tables would really speed up my workflow in combination with simple mixins. That's why I created Taiga, an environment to love.</p>
